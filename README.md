# simpaux
simple auxiliary network for metalearning

The ProtoNet++ code is built on top of the [ProtoNet example](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-meta/tree/master/examples/protonet) by @tristandeleu.

The `simpaux_dev.sh` script depends on the helper scripts for establishing persistent ssh connections [here](https://github.com/vmichals/ssh_persistent_connection_helpers). You just have to clone the repo and put the local folder in your $PATH.
